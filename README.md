Project is done.

You can use this project to check that your password is secure enough.

Uses the Have I Been Pwned API.

Simply run the main.py file from the command line and include the passwords that you want to check as
the arguments. 

Example: Python3 main.py hello123 test123 password123 

The example above checks if the three passwords (hello123, test123 or password123) have been widely used.

You should AT LEAST get 0 results. Change your password immediately if the program returns even 1 result.
